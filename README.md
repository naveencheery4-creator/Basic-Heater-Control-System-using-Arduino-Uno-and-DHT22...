# Basic-Heater-Control-System-using-Arduino-Uno-and-DHT22...
Purpose: This project design and implement a heater control system using an Arduino Uno that reads temperature from a DHT22 sensor, tracks system states (Idle, Heating, Stabilizing, Target Reached, Overheat), and controls a simulated heater (LED) with overheat protection (buzzer alert).
